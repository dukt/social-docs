# Google

Follow these steps to configure Google for social login:

## OAuth Configuration

1. Go to the [Google Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/).
1. Create a new project.
1. Go to **Google Console → My Project → Credentials → Consent Screen** and make sure to fill the Product name field.
1. Go to **Google Console → My Project → Credentials** and create credentials for a new “OAuth client ID” with the following settings:
   
   - Application type: Web application
   - Authorized JavaScript origins: The web origin URL can be found in `CP → Settings → Social → Login Providers → Google`
   - Authorized redirect URIs: The redirect URL can be found in `CP → Settings → Social → Login Providers → Google`

1. Google will provide you a client ID and client secret for your application, copy them into a `craft/config/social.php` file with the following settings:
    
    ```php
    <?php
    
    return [
        'loginProviders' => [
            'google' => [
                'clientId' => '000000000000-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com',
                'clientSecret' => 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
            ],
        ]
    ];
    ```

1. Go to **CP → Settings → Social → Login Providers** and enable Google
