# Twitter

Follow these steps to configure Twitter for social login:

## OAuth Configuration

### Create a new app
1. Go to the [Twitter Application Manager](https://dev.twitter.com/apps).
1. Click “Create New App” to create a new Twitter application
1. Fill all required fields
1. Fill the “Callback URL” field with the Redirect URI found in **CP → Settings → Social → Login Providers → Twitter**
1. Agree the terms and save the application

### Setup app permissions
1. First, we need to whitelist your app to be able to request the user email. Go to [https://support.twitter.com/forms/platform](https://support.twitter.com/forms/platform)
1. Click “I need access to special permissions” and fill your application details.
1. In **Permissions Requested** ask for the “email” special permission
1. Twitter will send you an email to confirm that you have email access (usually takes less than 24 hours)
1. Now go back to Twitter Application manager and click on the app that you've just created to edit it
1. Under **Permissions → Access**, select “Read and write” (don't choose the one that gives access to direct message otherwise social login will fail)
1. Under **Permissions → Additional Permissions**, check the **Request email addresses from users** box (this will only be visible once Twitter has whitelisted your app)

### OAuth settings in Craft
1. Twitter will provide you a client ID (consumer key) and client secret (consumer secret) for your application, copy them into a `craft/config/social.php` file with the following settings:
    
    ```php
    <?php
    
    return [
        'loginProviders' => [
            'twitter' => [
                'clientId' => 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
                'clientSecret' => 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
            ],
        ]
    ];
    ```

1. Go to **CP → Settings → Social → Login Providers** and enable Twitter
