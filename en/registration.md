# Registration

With Social, registration becomes as simple as a click.

## Usage

```twig
<a href="{{ craft.social.loginUrl('google') }}">Login with Google</a>
```

## User mapping

When a user registers on your website with Social login, data can be imported from the userâ€™s social profile, and be used to create the Craft user.

By default, the plugin automatically maps the `email` and `username` Craft user fields with the `{{ email }}` profile variable, this way new users already have their email address set, with their email as username.

The field mapping can be customized by creating a `craft/config/social.php` config file:

```php
<?php


return [
    'loginProviders' => [
        'google' => [
            
            ...
            
            'userMapping' => [
                'firstName' => '{{ firstName }}',
                'lastName' => '{{ lastName }}',
            ],
        ],
        'facebook' => [
            
            ...
            
            'userMapping' => [
                'firstName' => '{{ firstName }}',
                'lastName' => '{{ lastName }}',
                'location' => '{{ locationName }}',
                'gender' => '{{ gender }}',
                'profileUrl' => '{{ link }}',
            ],
        ],
        'twitter' => [
            
            ...
            
            'userMapping' => [
                'location' => '{{ location }}',
                'profileUrl' => '{{ nickname }}',
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

Login providers have a `userMapping` config which expects an array, with Craft user field handles as keys (make sure the fields exist), and a template string as value where all profile variables are available.

Each login provider comes with its own set of profile variables, [check login provider pages](../README.md#login-providers) to see the supported variables.
